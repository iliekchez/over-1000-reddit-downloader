# over-1000-reddit-downloader
a reddit downloader thing that can download more than 1000 images


this requires psaw

that should be it


## over_1000_reddit_downloader
this can download any number of posts from whatever subreddit you want, provided that they are direct links to images

this creates a "bad links" file (if you had bad links) after it's done

you can use that with ripme or jdownloader or whatever you want to download whatever else you need to

## linkgrabber
essentially the other one, but doesn't actually download and instead puts every single link into a file, so you can run that through whatever
