# over-1000-reddit-downloader
a reddit downloader thing that can download more than 1000 images


this requires psaw

that should be it


this creates a "bad links" file (if you had bad links) after it's done
you can use that with ripme or jdownloader or whatever you want to download whatever else you need to
